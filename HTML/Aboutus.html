                            <p>
                            Most of our time is spend on gathering more data and updating our routing table, so we regulary spend our time optimising routes according to whatever road circumstances. This means that we have a dedicated 24 hour route optimisation team waiting to change routes to offer the best services possible
                            </p><p>
                            This hands-on approach is the most effective way to ensure that commuters have access to the most effecient routes predetermined by current conditions.

                            <p>
                            We believe commuters have the right to know what affects the costs of the journeys. At Warthog Express Liner we reveal our true costs, and then we show you our markup.

                            <p>
                            We constantly challenge the status quo. Nothing is worse than complacency, and as a service provider, our culture is to dissect every single decision we make at every level of the company.
                            
                            We know our commuters demand quality service, and, comfortable and good looking vehicles, so we hope this philosophy is palpable in the services we offer and the choices we make. And by all means, challenge us too.
