                <p>The data will continue to be updated as time goes by. The multiplications simply mean that the normal fee a customer is supposed to pay is multiplied by the number in the respective column of comfort choice. for example: for a user to go from Alibamastraat West Acres Extension 6 to Alingsingel Nelspruit Extension 2, it would cost them the price of of the day, lets say its a Monday and the they going economy, the price stays the same. it only changes if the comfor choice is upgraded or the transportation occurs during the weekend or on a public holiday.</p>
